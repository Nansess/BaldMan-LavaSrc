# BaldMan LavaSrc

## Purpose

BaldMan LavaSrc is a fork with a simple yet effective goal: provide an alternative method to interact with audio sources like Spotify and Apple Music without the hassle of managing API keys. The intent is to simplify the setup process for developers who prefer a straightforward approach to audio sourcing.

## Key Features

- **Spotify :**  search Spotify without the need for a client ID or secret.
- **Apple Music :**  Apple Music features without requiring an API key.

## Upcoming Plans

- **Deezer ARL Support:** We're working on adding ARL support for Deezer, which will allow 1000kbps+ Playback, 320kbps, and the regular 120kbps
