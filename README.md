Well, that's it, folks. Everything I have worked on for Baldman over the last two years has finally been mergedâ€”Apple token extraction, Tidal mirroring, Spotify token extraction. I have finally pushed all of those changes and will maintain them on the official LavaSrc: https://github.com/topi314/LavaSrc.  

It was lovely maintaining this. Make sure to migrate, as this will never receive another update again.
